# Machine Learning Model for Educational Background Classification

This repository contains the code and analysis for training a machine learning model to classify candidates' educational backgrounds based on various features such as constituency, party affiliation, criminal records, and financial assets.

## Description

The provided code uses a RandomForestClassifier to perform multi-class classification on the given dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Instructions

1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Clone the repository: 
3. Navigate to the repository directory:
4. Place the training and test datasets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) in the same directory as the code.
5. Run the code:


6. The model predictions will be saved to `my_submission_rf_improved_2.csv`.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of the following main sections:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization and analysis
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction on the test set

## Results

The F1 score on the validation set is approximately 0.1925. Despite the modest performance, the analysis provides valuable insights into the distribution of candidates' attributes and their correlation with educational backgrounds.

## Leaderboard Performance

- Public score: 0.26248
- Rank: 20 (after removing unofficial submissions)
- Number of submissions: 4
